# Alexa--Smart-Voice-Recognizer
A voice-controlled system that can accomplish some tasks using our voice.

Firstly we would need to download certain libraries which are mentioned in the code.

After that we decide which actions which we want our alexa to perform and in which voice and can make changes accordingly as mentioned in the code itself

Then we run this code in the system on any platform like spyder or anaconda

Note : This system is not accurate in noisy places, so try in some silent enviornment and can play songs on youtube, tell you a joke and much more...
